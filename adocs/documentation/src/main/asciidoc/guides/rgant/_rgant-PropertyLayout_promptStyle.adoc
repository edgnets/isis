The `promptStyle()` attribute is used to specify whether a domain object property is edited through a dialog box (similar to an action parameter form) or using an inline edit.

If the attribute is not set, then thevalue of the xref:../rgcfg/rgcfg.adoc#_rgcfg_configuring-core[configuration property] `isis.objects.promptStyle` is used.
If this is itself not set, then a dialog box is used.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    @Property(
        promptStyle=PromptStyle.INLINE
    )
    public int getNotes(){ ... }
    public void setNotes(String notes) { ... }
}
----
